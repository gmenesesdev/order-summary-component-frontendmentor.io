## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Root variables


### What I learned

This time I had some difficulty aligning the PLAN section (price, icon and link) correctly. To do this, I had to learn about grid to be able to give it a correct format.

I still need to adjust some details but I have to continue testing and correcting what I am doing.

### Continued development

I would like to refine some details, especially regarding the sizes on the different devices. I want everything to be full responsive.

### Useful resources
